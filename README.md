### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught developer living in Dayton, OH.

Currently working on:

- Rust + Xlib exploration: check out [patina](https://github.com/jechasteen/patina)
- Rust + JS exploration: I've got a minimal example of Rocket (rust webserver framework) serving webpack'd React in [react_rocket_template](https://github.com/jechasteen/react_rocket_template)
- Trying to get my head around the Rust compiler. I recently volunteered to help with prioritization of compiler issues.
- I'm looking for my first rustc PR rn.
